  <h1><center>Critical Discussion</center></h1>
  <p><center>With the recent introduction of powerful new A.I. such as CHAT-GPT and the continued advancement of voice recognition technology, virtual assistants b could soon enter the realm of what was once sci-fi. Like the cars in the early 20th century an ever-growing number of people could soon have a customizable virtual assistant that can answer all your questions. With something so human like the effects on the loneliness epidemic could be greatly exacerbated. Such technology can have a significant impact on politics. If it is actively connected to the internet or the model has significant bias, we could see people's opinions and political preferences change if people use the technology heavily.</center></p>
  <p><center>If we are to look at the technology from different ethical lenses it needs to be examined as applied to different aspects of life. If applied to education one can think of a tool humans have real time dialog within order to help them learn the subject matter and complete the assignment. We can also imagine an improper use wherein students only learn how to interact with the assistant as far as getting it too correctly think through problems. This is without learning any of the material themselves. On the one hand, we can have humans that are super learners able to bootstrap arbitrarily complex information and put it to use. On the other hand, we have humans who are masters of getting the technology to accomplish tasks only knowing the minimum necessary amount of information. The former could have a beneficial impact when it comes to human creativity, engineering, learning, etc. The latter could be very dangerous as we may know none of the implications of the actions we take. The most likely outcome is we have some ratio of both. God help is in so that former be as large of a piece as possible.  </center></p>
  <p><center> The path forward is narrow so how we proceed is of the upmost importance. I would say we’re walking across a type of rope but that would be underselling the difficulty of what we’re undertaking. On one hand if we do absolutely nothing regarding policy and recommendations, we run the risk of a cancerous form of the technology becoming the dominant form. However, if we put so many rules in place that we significantly raise the cost of development past the point of the small or medium sized company we risk a possibly equally as bad outcome. The technology could end up never being developed harming future economic growth, or we could end up unintentionally creating a regulated monopoly. To help solve this problem I would recommend creating a comprehensive citizen board as was done in California in 1967. This citizen board would be advised by a large group of scientists from various schools. People from not only A.I./voice recognition fields but also economic, agricultural, developmental biology, math and many more. This initiative would be nationwide and last 3-5 years. A version of this plan that works on a state-by-state basis should also be considered and may even be favorable as it would better take into account local conditions. If any rules are to be applied to the field, I think they should overwhelmingly be general rules that set standards rather than force specific development paths. This is because we don’t want to automatically rule out any presently unknown but beneficial developments. </center></p>
